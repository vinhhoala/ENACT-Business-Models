Monitoring has always been a crtitical feature for IT management. However, large deployments suffer from the "christmas tree" effect: lots of alarms triggering at the same time requires lots of expertise for administrators to identify the correct culprits, ignore false alarms and trigger the right countermeasure. There are systems that can perform root cause analysis of an infrastructure, but they require deep domain knowledge, which is impractical to elicit and maintain in large and fast changing deployments. Customers are continually looking to automate the identification of critical errors within enterprise scale deployments enabling faster and more accurate root cause analysis in order to facilate the decision making regarding their mitigation</p>

      <p>Montimage will put the research outcome related to root cause analysis into a product that will extend the company portfolio. The product will also be integrated into to monitoring solution of Montimage (MMT) to allow better insight on detected functional and non-functional incidents. The product tool will be called MMT-RCA and will be exploited by selling licences and by offring IT services arount it to adapt to some customers needs.  </p>
