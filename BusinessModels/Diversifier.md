Current solutions: Current solutions: (i) Existing deployment tools such as Ansible and GeneSIS on targeting at single IoT device sets, but not a large number of similar device sets (IoT fleet). (ii) fleet management tools or platforms, such as Azure IoT Hub, Balena, etc., do not support diversity managemnet among the fleet.
